## Internship Milestone Submission – Milestone 1

This repository contains the complete system analysis and requirement documentation for the modernization of legacy VXML-based IVR systems using Conversational AI platforms.
# Conversational IVR Modernization Framework



## 1. Project Overview

The Conversational IVR Modernization Framework focuses on upgrading traditional VoiceXML (VXML)-based IVR systems by integrating them with modern Conversational AI platforms such as ACS and BAP services.

Traditional IVR systems rely on keypad-based interaction (DTMF) and predefined call flows. While these systems are stable and reliable, they lack natural language understanding and conversational intelligence.

This project aims to enhance user experience while preserving existing legacy infrastructure.



## 2. Problem Statement

Legacy IVR systems have the following limitations:

- Rigid menu-driven interaction
- Dependency on keypad input
- No natural speech understanding
- Complex maintenance for call flow updates
- Limited personalization

Modern users expect intelligent systems that allow natural conversation and faster resolution.



## 3. Milestone 1 Scope

Milestone 1 includes:

- Detailed analysis of legacy VXML-based IVR systems
- Identification of system limitations
- Functional requirement documentation
- Non-functional requirement documentation
- Proposed integration architecture
- Risk and challenge assessment
